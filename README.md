# Two Squares Game
This is my first project using python programming language :)=

## Description

This game is played on a board of 4x4 squares and two players take turns; each of them takes turn to place a rectangle (that covers two squares) on the board, covering any 2 squares. Only one rectangle can be on a square. A square cannot be covered twice. The last player who can place a card on the board is the winner.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 4x4 board.
2. Two players take turns to place a rectangle (covering two squares) on the board.
3. Players input two numbers representing the squares they want to cover.
4. The player who cannot place a rectangle on the board loses the game.
5. The last player to place a rectangle wins the game.
